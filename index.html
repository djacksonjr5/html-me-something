            A Few People in my Inner Council
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            I've read in many places (but can't seem to find where) that one way 
            to figure out what to do with yourself in confusing times is to keep 
            an inner council of wise people you admire. It seems a little hokey 
            to have a group of historical (or still living) figures living in 
            your imagination giving you high fives and advising on whether your 
            latest boo deserves a fifth date. It sounds kind of dumb when said 
            aloud, but if you can get past the seeming childishness of having 
            the grown-up version of imaginary friends, it can actually be a useful 
            way to draw inspiration, clarify personal values, and strengthen 
            character.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to cultivate this inner council, I grabbed photos of 
            people that I admired from Google Image Search (while my boss wasn't 
            looking) and put it on my personal flash drive. When I got home, I would 
            spend time looking at the pictures and thinking about the things that 
            I admired about each of them. This list isn't comprehensive, but maybe 
            it'll give you an idea about whether this kind of thing is for you or 
            not.

        <h3>Jaron Lanier</h3>
        <p>
            Jaron Lanier was a tech pioneer involved in the earliest days
            of virtual reality programs. These days he gives talks and writes 
            about the consequences of technological design choices on everyday 
            people. He is currently advocating for people to delete their 
            social media accounts due to their algorithms promoting anger 
            and fear as a way of maximising user engagement. I feel like 
            he's got a point, and I really appreciate his honesty and 
            forward-thinking into technology and society. I'm still not
            going to delete my Twitter account, though.

        <h3>Reggie Watts</h3>
        <p>
            Reggie Watts is equal parts bonkers, brilliance, and heart. His 
            ability to make beatbox grooves topped with absurdist lyrics 
            is unparalleled. He seems to be creativity personified, all while 
            radiating a mischievous kindness. It's like he was born to help 
            us rediscover playfulness and joy.

        <h3>Shunryu Suzuki</h3>
        <p>
            Author of the classic Zen Mind, Beginners Mind, Shunryu Suzuki 
            embodies qualities of peace and openness. He advocates for 
            never losing beginner's mind, which is applicable to anybody, 
            whether you're a Zen practitioner or a web developer. We can 
            always learn more, and it is at the times when we think we 
            have all the answers that we're most likely to miss important 
            details.

        <h3>Shinzen Young</h3>
        <p>
            Shinzen Young is an American meditation teacher whom I affectionately 
            call a "magical nerd." Starting off as a geeky kid in love with 
            Japanese culture, he traveled to Japan and endured grueling Shingon
            initiation practices of isolation and winter ice baths and in a quest 
            for enlightenment. Thankfully, his meditation teaching is not so 
            severe, using scientific language to make Eastern practices more 
            understandable to a Western audience.

        <img src="images/Unknown-40.jpeg" alt="Edgar Wright">
        <h3>Edgar Wright</h3>
        <p>
            Edgar Wright is a British filmmaker most known for his films 
            Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. His films are characterized 
            by quick cuts, hilarious dialogue, and well-planned 
            foreshadowing. He is quite influential, and his visual style 
            is influencing such American comedies as This Is The End and 
            Game Night.

        <h3>Keith Johnstone</h3>
        <p>
            Keith Johnstone is the author of the book Impro, which is one of 
            the most insightful books I've ever read. On the surface, it is 
            about improvisational theater, but it is about far more, including 
            education, psychology, and social interaction. Once I realized that 
            all everyday interactions with other people could be viewed as 
            an improvisational theater game, it became easier to notice when I 
            was being a jerk and why when I otherwise wouldn't have had that awareness.
