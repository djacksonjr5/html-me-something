            Staring at Faces as a Meditation Practice

            I've read in many places (but can't seem to find where) that one way 
            to figure out what to do with yourself in confusing times is to keep 
            an inner council of wise people you admire. It seems a little hokey 
            to have a group of historical (or still living) figures living in 
            your imagination giving you high fives and advising on whether your 
            latest boo deserves a fifth date. It sounds kind of dumb when said 
            aloud, but if you can get past the seeming childishness of having 
            the grown-up version of imaginary friends, it can actually be a useful 
            way to draw inspiration, clarify personal values, and strengthen 
            character.
        </p>

            In order to cultivate this inner council, I grabbed photos of 
            people that I admired from Google Image Search (while my boss wasn't 
            looking) and put it on my personal flash drive. When I got home, I would 
            spend time looking at the pictures and thinking about the things that 
            I admired about each of them. This list isn't comprehensive, but maybe 
            it'll give you an idea about whether this kind of thing is for you or 
            not.
